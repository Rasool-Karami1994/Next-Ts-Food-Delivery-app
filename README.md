# Next.js Test Application

This is a sample application built with Next.js 14 to demonstrate modern web development techniques and best practices. The project takes advantage of Next.js features such as Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) and dynamic imports for improved performance. It also uses Zustand for state management (with persist capabilities) and Tailwind CSS for responsive design and dark mode support.

## Features

- **Next.js 14:** Utilizes the latest framework features for SSR, ISR, and overall performance enhancements.
- **Zustand:** Provides simple, scalable state management with persistent storage.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Supports rapid UI development with responsive and dark mode styling.
- **Dynamic Imports:** Implements code splitting out of the box to reduce bundle size and improve load times.
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):** Rebuilds static pages periodically to ensure data freshness without compromising speed.
- **Optimized Images:** Uses the built-in Next.js Image component for automatic image optimization.
 ```
